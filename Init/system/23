# 23. Explain how connect yourself as new user. (With graphic session and ssh session)

To connect via ssh we need to type '$ ssh -X user@server_ip'
Insert password and done.
We can connect with no using password:
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
$ ssh-copy-id server_ip
Now we will connect via pair RSA keys.

To install graphic session (to be able to display server's apps on our host):

On server set in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
X11Forwarding yes

On local set in /etc/ssh/ssh_config:
ForwardX11 yes

If you are on Mac install Xquartz utility, run it, logout and login.

After that you can open any apps such as xclock, vscode, atril, etc.
and they will be displayed like on your machine.
